# DistilGPT2 Text Generation Model with Transformers and Qwak

## Overview

This project uses a simplified version of the GPT-2 model, known as DistilGPT2, for efficient text generation. It's implemented using the [Qwak's Machine Learning Platform](https://www.qwak.com/)  and Transformers libraries.

It covers:
- QwakModel class definition
- Model initialization
- Text generation via Qwak's Predict API

The code is designed to work seamlessly with Qwak's platform and serves as a practical example.

## How to Test Locally


1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed, as specified in the `conda.yml` file.

    ```bash
    conda env create -f main/conda.yaml
    conda activate distilgpt2
    ```

3. **Install and Configure the Qwak SDK**: Use your account [Qwak API Key](https://docs.qwak.com/docs/getting-started#configuring-qwak-sdk) to set up your SDK locally.

    ```bash
    pip install qwak-sdk
    qwak configure
    ```

5. **Run the Model Locally**: Execute the following command to test the model locally:

   ```bash
   python test_model_locally.py
   ```

## How to Run Remotely on Qwak

1. **Build on the Qwak Platform**:

    Create a new model on Qwak using the command:

    ```bash
    qwak models create "DistilGPT2 LLM" --project "Sample Project"
    ```


    Initiate a model build with:

    ```bash
    qwak models build --model-id <your-model-id> ./distilgpt2_conda
    ```


2. **Deploy the Model on the Qwak Platform with a Real-Time Endpoint**:

    To deploy your model via the CLI, use the following command:

    ```bash
    qwak models deploy realtime --model-id <your-model-id> --build-id <your-build-id>
    ```

3. **Test the Live Model with a Sample Request**:

    Install the Qwak Inference SDK:

    ```bash
    pip install qwak-inference
    ```

    Call the Real-Time endpoint using your Model ID from the Qwak platform:

    ```bash
    python test_live_mode.py <your-qwak-model-id>
    ```
