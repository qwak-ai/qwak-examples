    "# Qwak Feature Store Example - Batch Feature Set with Koalas Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Qwak Feature Store example! In this tutorial, we'll guide you through creating a sample Data Source, transforming it into a Feature Set, and leveraging its features for model training and inference using the Qwak Platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "Guides like this one aim to provide you with a starting point by offering a straightforward framework for working with Qwak. However, we encourage you to explore our [comprehensive documentation](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/feature-store-overview) for more detailed and specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in, make sure you have the Qwak SDK installed and authenticated. If you haven't done so already, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Install the Qwak SDK](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/installing-the-qwak-sdk) - Ensure you have the SDK installed on your local environment.\n",
    "2. [Authenticate](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/installing-the-qwak-sdk#1-via-qwak-cli) - Authenticate with a new Personal or Service Qwak API Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a deeper understanding of Feature Stores and their importance in machine learning workflows, we recommend checking out our comprehensive [documentation](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/feature-store-overview) and our blog article on [What is a Feature Store](https://www.qwak.com/post/what-is-a-feature-store-in-ml).

    "### Additional Considerations for Registering Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "When registering Data Sources in Qwak, it's essential to ensure that the underlying data store is accessible by the platform. Depending on your deployment model (Hybrid or SaaS), there are different ways to grant Qwak access to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing AWS Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is stored in AWS services, you can grant access to Qwak using an IAM role ARN. For detailed instructions, refer to our documentation on [Accessing AWS Resources with IAM Role](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/accessing-aws-resources-with-iam-role).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Qwak Secrets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can pass the credentials as Qwak Secrets. This approach provides a secure way to manage and authenticate access to your data. For more information, see [Qwak Secret Management](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/secret-management).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the types of Data Sources supported by Qwak, refer to our documentation:\n",
    "- [Batch Data Sources](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/batch-data-sources)\n",
    "- [Streaming Data Sources](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/streaming-data-sources)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sampling Data from the Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the data source cannot be used as a query engine independently (for now). Instead, it serves as a sampling mechanism to verify that the data is being queried properly.\n"

    "## Creating the Batch Feature Set from the Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a Feature Set, it typically consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metadata:** Includes name, key, data sources, and the timestamp column used for indexing.\n",
    "- **Scheduling Expression:** For Batch Feature Sets, this defines when ingestion jobs should run.\n",
    "- **Cluster Type:** Specifies the resources to use for running the ingestion job.\n",
    "- **Backfill:** Determines how far back in time the Feature Set should ingest data.\n",
    "- **Transformation:** Can be SQL-based or UDF-based (currently Koalas) for data transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Read Policies](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/read-policies) instruct Qwak on which data to fetch from the Data Source. \n",
    "- **NewOnly:** Fetches records created after the last ingestion.\n",
    "- **TimeFrame:** Fetches records within a specified timeframe.\n",
    "- **FullRead:** Fetches all data from the Data Source in every ingestion job, which can be heavy for main tables but useful for foreign key-based tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we'll use FullRead since our sample Data Source is static, consisting of a single CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution specification refers to the size of the cluster used for data ingestion. More information can be found in the [Qwak docs](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/instance-sizes#feature-store).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Koalas transformation process\n",
    "\n",
    "As you're aware, a Koalas DataFrame is akin to a pandas DataFrame but operates across a Spark cluster. Once your data resides in a Koalas dataframe, it's advisable to carry out transformations directly within Koalas rather than switching to other data types like pandas. This is because switching to other dataframes, such as pandas, consolidates the distributed data into a single node, leading to sequential computation rather than parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The qwak `transform` method should return a KoalasTransformation object, indicating your end-to-end transformation function, in this case, `extract_features`. You're not restricted to a single function; you can divide the logic into as many as necessary and call them within a main function passed to the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function's input will be a Python dictionary with data source names as keys and their associated values as Koalas DataFrames containing the ingested data from the DataSource.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while this code is callable locally, via `get_sample()`` as demonstrated in the next cell, it's not available for debugging, as the actual transformations will be executed remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "To utilize Koalas Transformation effectively, **ensure you have Python 3.8 installed** and `cloudpickle` locked to version `2.2.1`, as your code will be pickled and provided to Qwak for registration and testing."
