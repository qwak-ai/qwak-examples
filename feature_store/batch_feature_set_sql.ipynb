    "# Qwak Feature Store Example - Batch Feature Set with SQL Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Qwak Feature Store example! In this tutorial, we'll guide you through creating a sample Data Source, transforming it into a Feature Set, and leveraging its features for model training and inference using the Qwak Platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "Guides like this one aim to provide you with a starting point by offering a straightforward framework for working with Qwak. However, we encourage you to explore our [comprehensive documentation](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/feature-store-overview) for more detailed and specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in, make sure you have the Qwak SDK installed and authenticated. If you haven't done so already, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Install the Qwak SDK](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/installing-the-qwak-sdk) - Ensure you have the SDK installed on your local environment.\n",
    "2. [Authenticate](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/installing-the-qwak-sdk#1-via-qwak-cli) - Authenticate with a new Personal or Service Qwak API Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a deeper understanding of Feature Stores and their importance in machine learning workflows, we recommend checking out our comprehensive [documentation](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/feature-store-overview) and our blog article on [What is a Feature Store](https://www.qwak.com/post/what-is-a-feature-store-in-ml).

    "In Qwak, a Data Source serves as a configuration object that specifies how to access and fetch your data. It includes metadata such as name and description, connection details to the data store/storage, the query or resource to retrieve, and the relevant time column for indexing time series features.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Metadata**: Includes information like name, description, etc.\n",

    "4. **Time Column**: Specifies the relevant time column for indexing time series features.\n",

    "In the following example, we'll connect to a publicly accessible S3 bucket and fetch data from a single CSV file, for simplicity.\n"

    "### Additional Considerations for Registering Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "When registering Data Sources in Qwak, it's essential to ensure that the underlying data store is accessible by the platform. Depending on your deployment model (Hybrid or SaaS), there are different ways to grant Qwak access to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing AWS Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is stored in AWS services, you can grant access to Qwak using an IAM role ARN. For detailed instructions, refer to our documentation on [Accessing AWS Resources with IAM Role](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/accessing-aws-resources-with-iam-role).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Qwak Secrets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can pass the credentials as Qwak Secrets. This approach provides a secure way to manage and authenticate access to your data. For more information, see [Qwak Secret Management](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/secret-management).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the types of Data Sources supported by Qwak, refer to our documentation:\n",
    "- [Batch Data Sources](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/batch-data-sources)\n",
    "- [Streaming Data Sources](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/streaming-data-sources)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Data from the Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the data source cannot be used as a query engine independently (for now). Instead, it serves as a sampling mechanism to verify that the data is being queried properly.\n"

    "- **Metadata:** Includes name, key, data sources, and the timestamp column used for indexing.\n",
    "- **Scheduling Expression:** For Batch Feature Sets, this defines when ingestion jobs should run.\n",

    "- **Backfill:** Determines how far back in time the Feature Set should ingest data.\n",

    "- **TimeFrame:** Fetches records within a specified timeframe.\n",
    "- **FullRead:** Fetches all data from the Data Source in every ingestion job, which can be heavy for main tables but useful for foreign key-based tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we'll use NewOnly since our sample Data Source is static, consisting of a single CSV file.\n",
